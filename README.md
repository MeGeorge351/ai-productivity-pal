## 📌 Project Overview

**WorkFlow AI** is a responsive web application designed to eliminate friction in daily professional workflows. By automating repetitive administrative tasks—such as drafting nuanced correspondence, extracting action items from lengthy meetings, and prioritizing chaotic task lists—WorkFlow AI frees knowledge workers to focus on high-leverage problem solving.

The platform combines a calm, low-glare user experience with standardized responsible AI practices, deep work timers, and centralized loading indicators.
